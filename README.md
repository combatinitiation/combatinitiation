<p align="center">isla ⊹ 19 ⊹ <b>one/one's</b> or <b>she/her</b> idc that much</p>
<p align="center">im too old to have an extensive dni, ok to interact <b>as long as youre not a bigot and/or younger than 16</b></p>
<br>
<p>⊹ <b>pony townie of roughly 7 years</b>. i might be chronically online but i definitely cant yap to save my life (i dont accept anything from strangers so no w2i or friend/party requests. i will only stick with public chat if i dont know you)</p>
<p>⊹ <b>doomed fandom girl (gender neutral) stuck in roblox superhell</b>. currently a huge fan of <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/13559635034/Combat-Initiation">combat initiation</a>, and used to be super into regretevator <s>to the point of claiming the github username <a href="https://github.com/regretevator">regretevator</a> and not letting go of it since then</s> but i dont want to associate with the game or its community anymore lol. those arent the only roblox games ive enjoyed ever, but i would prefer to keep the rest unlisted since their communities are kinda dead anyway. outside of roblox, im also in the osc (not as strongly as i once was though)</p>
<p>⊹ <b>still working to elaborate more on my lore</b>. this readme will be gradually updated every once in a while. until then, *drops mic*</p>
